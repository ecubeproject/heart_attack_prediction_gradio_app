# heart_attack_prediction_gradio_app
A gradio app based on XGBoost classifier with 97% F1-Score on real data for predicting probability of heart-attack. Its basic versionis deployed on hugging face at https://huggingface.co/spaces/minusquare/gradio_app.

Okay next project was based on real health-care data. It deals with prediction of risk of cardiac failure based on clinical and life style features. Highlights of the apps were:
(a) Reliable real data
(b) Highly accurate prediction model
(c) An attractive user interface with a risk-meter and SHAP analysis that not only gives diagnosis but also guides patient about which clinical/life-style features are responsible for increasing heart-attack risk and which are helping to prevent heart attack. This helps to modify the life-style and also helps doctor to adjust/change medications.
